# Global Energy Trends: A Visual Analytics Approach  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository presents a **data-driven exploration** of global energy trends using **visual analytics techniques**. Leveraging the **Our World in Data (OWID) energy dataset**, this project examines patterns in **energy production, consumption, and sustainability** over time. The analysis is supported by structured **visualizations and interactive dashboards**, offering insights into key energy transitions worldwide.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 📊 **Analyze** historical and current global energy trends.  
- 🔍 **Visualize** energy production and consumption across different sources.  
- 🌍 **Investigate** regional disparities in energy access and sustainability.  
- 🏭 **Examine** the shift towards renewable energy sources.  
- 📈 **Provide** data-driven insights to support energy policy discussions.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for static visualizations  
- **Plotly** for interactive dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization  

## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses the **OWID Energy Dataset**, which includes:  
- **Global energy consumption** by source  
- **CO₂ emissions** related to energy production  
- **Renewable vs. non-renewable** energy trends  
- **Country-wise and regional** energy statistics
